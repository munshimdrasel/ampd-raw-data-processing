# AMPD Raw data Processing

In this repository I'm trying wrangle on AMPD daily raw emission data (downloaded from AMPD website: more on getting-raw-ampd-data repository)

Features:
  1. You'll be able to generate facility wise monthly and yearly emission data which can be used in disperseR package (updated data from 1997 to 2021)
  2. You'll be able to generate time series plot of NOx, SO2, CO2 emissions from power plants
  3. You'll get all the information regarding a facility in the datasets (Fuel types used, location, capacity of plants, NOx, SOx, PM control etc.)

All the data are available on GMU ARGO cluster in HAQ_LAB project directory (/projects/HAQ_LAB/mrasel/ampd-data/ampd-processed/data)
